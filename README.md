# Angular course

The "Angular" course provides knowledge and practical skills for 
building client applications (Single Page Applications) with Angular technology, 
a working framework created by Google and one of the most popular at the moment. 
It teaches us what TypeScript is, basic syntax and concepts, and what else it doesn't offer
over JavaScript, such as convenience for developing in the browser and on mobile platforms.
Learn what Single Page Application (SPA) is, architectural patterns for SPA applications,
components, directives and their implementation in Angular. Views and templates for data
visualization (templates), models, components, data binding, working with many views,
observables, routing, extracting data from a REST service and injecting dependencies
are studied (DI).
