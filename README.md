# Angular course

The "Angular" course provides knowledge and practical skills for 
building client applications (<strong>Single Page Applications</strong>) with <a href="https://angular.io/"><strong>Angular</strong></a> technology, 
a working framework created by <strong>Google</strong> and one of the most popular at the moment. 
It offers knowledge about <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/"><strong>Typescript</strong></a> and its basic syntax and concepts, and what else it doesn't offer
over <strong>JavaScript</strong>, such as convenience for developing in the browser and on mobile platforms.
Learn what <strong>Single Page Application</strong> (<strong>SPA</strong>) is, architectural patterns for <strong>SPA</strong> applications,
components, directives and their implementation in <a href="https://angular.io/"><strong>Angular</strong></a>. Views and templates for data
visualization (templates), models, components, data binding, working with many views,
observables, routing, extracting data from a <strong>REST</strong> service and injecting dependencies
are studied (<strong>DI</strong>).
